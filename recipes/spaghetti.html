<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Spaghetti: 400g of high-quality spaghetti pasta.</li>
    <li>Eggs: 4 large eggs, at room temperature.</li>
    <li>Pancetta: 150g of pancetta or guanciale (Italian cured pork jowl), diced.</li>
    <li>Parmesan Cheese: 1 cup of freshly grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
    <li>Black Pepper: Freshly ground black pepper to taste.</li>
    <li>Salt: A pinch of salt for seasoning.</li>
    <li>Olive Oil: 2 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil.</li>
    <li>Garlic: 2 cloves of garlic, minced (optional, for added flavor).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the spaghetti according to package instructions until al
        dente. Drain, reserving a cup of pasta water, and set aside.</li>
    <li>In a mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, grated Parmesan cheese, and a generous amount of freshly ground black
        pepper. Set aside.</li>
    <li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced pancetta and cook until it becomes crispy
        and golden brown.</li>
    <li>If using garlic, add it to the skillet with the pancetta and saut√© for a minute until fragrant (optional).</li>
    <li>Remove the skillet from heat.</li>
    <li>Immediately add the cooked and drained spaghetti to the skillet with the pancetta.</li>
    <li>Quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the hot spaghetti while tossing continuously. The residual heat
        will cook the eggs and form a creamy sauce.</li>
    <li>If the sauce seems too thick, add a little of the reserved pasta water gradually until you reach the desired
        consistency.</li>
    <li>Season with a pinch of salt, if needed (remember that the pancetta and cheese are already salty).</li>
    <li>Garnish with extra grated Parmesan cheese and a sprinkle of black pepper.</li>
    <li>Serve immediately and enjoy your delicious Spaghetti Carbonara!</li>
